# SpyParty

[SpyParty](http://www.spyparty.com/) is an awesome indie game by [Chris Hecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hecker). To say it's a complicated game is an understatement, and because it's complicated, nobody had really written a guide for beginners that wasn't entirely too long. Now the [Leaflet of SpyParty Strategies](https://spyparty.pages.dev/leaflet-of-spyparty-strategies) exists.

More coming, soon<sup>TM</sup>

## But actually:

This project started off as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site. I didn't have anything planned besides a simple text guide and wanted to check out Hugo, so it made sense. Then, I discovered [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/), which not only parses `.md` files as `html`, but also lets you inject [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) components! I've been enjoying Svelte and a few other things in [my other other project](https://github.com/kkudose/crewbattle) so I ported this project over. Now that it's powered by Svelte, I have some other ideas brewing...

To run locally, install dependencies:
```
pnpm i
```

Then run:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
