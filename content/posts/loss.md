SpyParty is complex and subtle; Leaflet of SpyParty Strategies is simple and absolute. This guide may be considered a tutorial supplement covering strategies rather than descriptions and definitions.

Don't miss out on better (but much more verbose) guides in the [SpyParty Discord](https://discord.gg/spyparty).

Terms to know:
| In-game | Community Shorthand |
| --- | --- |
| Bug The Ambassador | Bug |
| Contact the Double Agent | Contact |
| Transfer Microfilm | Transfer |
| Swap Statue | Swap |
| Purloin the Guest List | Purloin |
| Check Watch to Add Time | Add Time |


### SP0: Do missionsâ€”snipers are blind.
- If you don't finish missions, your only chance of winning is out of your hands.
- If you don't believe snipers are blind, why didn't you see the spy do that really obvious thing last time?

### SP1: Do something in the first 10s.
- The first 10s of each game is chaotic and ripe with opportunities.
- See if you are in a good position to complete Bug, Transfer, Swap, or Purloin. If not, Add Time.

### SP2: Follow the sniper's rules.
- SpyParty has many rules, but they are irrelevant if the sniper does not know them. Do not follow rules that are not being enforced (this is not life advice).

### SP3: Share banana bread with as many guests as possible, but not too often.
- When you Contact, minimize the guests outside of a conversation (since the sniper knows they're not the spy).
- Repeated Contact is generally a bad idea but may be useful as a distraction to to cover another mission.

### SP4: Don't be too predictable.
- Being a little predictable is fine.

### SP5: Leave the briefcase alone.
- There's [several](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Waj0T5ZvYo4V7p7EOFMOMNN8VQ2CeIk2wo8pk7f9pls/edit?usp=sharing) [guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oXj57k6cMA) dedicated entirely to this cursed object.
- tl:dr; pick up the case if it's near you but not near the Ambassador, then return the case to the Ambassador by standing behind them.
