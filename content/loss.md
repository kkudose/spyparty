SpyParty is complex and subtle; Leaflet of SpyParty Strategies is simple and absolute. This guide:

- is meant to be accessible with minimal jargon, but knowing the missions is a prerequisite.
- favors brevity over technical accuracy.

Don't miss out on better (but much more verbose) guides in the [SpyParty Discord](https://discord.gg/spyparty).

### 0: Review replays.
- Quickly review replays while in a match to see where things went wrong. Consider reviewing replays after a match as a more in-depth review.

## As Spy

### 1: Do missions—snipers are blind.
- If you don't finish missions, your only chance of winning is if the sniper happens to shoot a non-player character (NPC).
- If you don't believe snipers are blind, why didn't you see the spy do that really obvious thing last time?
- Note that walking away from the **Seduction Target** reduces the amount of time before you can **Seduce** again. Otherwise, the minimum wait time is 45s.

### 2: Be opportunistic, not reckless.
- How good any mission is depends on what's happening at that moment. Always be ready to take an opportunity when a mission is favorable—but beware that a mission can just as quickly become unfavorable.
- The first 10s is often a good opportunity to complete **Bug**, **Purloin**, **Swap**, or even **Add Time**. Everyone is moving during this time, making it difficult for the sniper to see.

### 3: Share banana bread generously, but infrequently.
- Maximize the people in conversations when you **Contact** (since anyone else is not the spy).
- Minimize the number of times you **Contact** each game (since each **Contact** gives info to the sniper). When you **Contact**, ensure you complete at least one mission (usually the **Contact** itself), and try to complete another mission immediately before or after.

### 4: You don't know what snipers know—find out, don't assume.
- There's actions or behaviors that a spy is *supposed* to follow to act like an NPC. Don't bother unless the sniper shoots you for not doing so.
- e.g. only a spy can **gulp** a drink (NPCs must sip thrice), but there's no harm in gulping if the sniper isn't going to notice.

## As Sniper

### 6: Hold steady—spies don't finish.
- Spies lose if they run out of time. Spies win if you shoot a non-player character.
- Wait until you have a high level of confidence rather than shooting on first suspicion.

### 7: Focus, but don't tunnel on people.
- If you tunnel, the only way you're going to win is if the spy runs out of time or you tunneled on the right person.

### 8: Prioritize missions, but do not be predictable.
- Watching all the missions poorly is worse than watching some of the missions well. However, if you are predictable, then the spy can avoid the missions you watch.
- Learn to actively watch for missions one at a time. With time, you will be able to passively watch some missions effectively.
- Note that **Add Time** is not a mission—a spy cannot win by adding time.

### 9: Light 'em up.
- Lights are the primary tool for a sniper and are most commonly used in the following ways, but the important part is making sure to use them:
    - Highlights—to indicate who has visited a statue (or completed Inspect).
    - Lowlights—to indicate who was outside of a conversation when **Contact** occurs (or more generally who is definitely not the spy).
- Many people also lowlight cast (people with triangles over them) since they cannot be the spy.

### Bonus: Leave the briefcase alone.
- The briefcase is complicated enough that there's [several](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Waj0T5ZvYo4V7p7EOFMOMNN8VQ2CeIk2wo8pk7f9pls/edit?usp=sharing) [guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oXj57k6cMA) dedicated entirely to this cursed object.
- (Spy) Pick up the case if it's near you but not near the **Ambassador**, then return the case to the **Ambassador** by standing behind them.
- (Sniper) If you think the way a person interacted with the briefcase is suspicious, don't risk your game on it—you're probably wrong—but remember it for the replay.
